# Welcome to DevOps
This is an outline of my NaLUG speech about the **DevOps** methodology.

## Small teams
The Jeff Bezos **2 pizza rule** is a guideline for deciding how many attendees should be invited to a meeting. According to the **rule**, every meeting should be small enough that attendees could be fed with two large **pizzas**.

## Learning culture
Businesses need to develop a learning culture — focusing on self-diagnosis, improvement, and knowledge sharing to not only respond rapidly to problems — but ensure lessons are captured and shared to reduce the risk of others in the organization from making the same mistakes. Organizations need to create a culture of learning, providing their staff with the autonomy and empowerment to self-organize to improve processes — providing staff the time to not only tackle those problems but also to share the learnings and create communities of practice to raise the overall capabilities of the organization as a whole.

## Blameless culture
Conduct blameless post-mortems as quickly as possible after a failure, bringing all stakeholders together to construct a timeline, understand contributions and errors, and identify and capture actions to prevent reoccurrence and ensuring failure leads to inquiry and not blame.

## Version control
Version Control Systems are important for simultaneous delopment, improving reliability, quality and monitoring.

## Automated tests
By creating a fast feedback loop of tests, that are taking the latest code, pushing to a production-like environment, and automatically testing the application at the most cost and resource-effective level — you can speed up your developer feedback loops to rapidly detect and correct errors as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Continuous integration
Merge code back to the master branch early and often, reducing the overhead of code integration, and providing fast feedback loops on the state of the code through complimentarily configured automated tests.

## Quick and safe production deployments
Deployments needs to be a routine to do in business hours, without downtime.

## Pervasive Telemetry of Code and Environments
To provide the highest system service levels, we must create visibility in the form of telemetry to monitor system performance an operation across applications and environments across development, pre-production, and production — allowing us to rapidly identify the root cause services and infrastructure creating service deviations, reducing the Mean Time To Repair. It’s not enough to capture telemetry, but we need to apply the right analysis and detection techniques to that telemetry to ensure we can identify valid and actionable deviations to the norm. The goal being — to be proactive by monitoring lead indicators of outages, aiming to detect and prevent them before they ever impact your customers.

## Agile and continuous delivery
The goal is to have testing and operations happening simultaneously with development. Collectively focusing on delivering value by reducing the lead time the customer experiences down to smallest possible time.
